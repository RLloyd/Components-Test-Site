#React + TypeScript + Vite + SASS
Testing environment for UI components, focusing specifically on a navigation system with theme switching capabilities. However, let me lay out what we could use it for based on the current setup:

Component Testing Site:


Test different UI components in isolation
Verify the functionality of the theming system (light/dark mode)
Experiment with the established color palette:

Primary: #8465C3 (Purple)
Secondary: #3AF1F9 (Cyan)
Accent: #F46A47 (Orange)
Success: #A2C465 (Green)
Warning: #FAD8B4 (Light Orange)
Danger: #F5536A (Red)

Design System Documentation:

We could expand it to showcase your design system elements:

Typography (Libre Baskerville for headers, Open Sans for body)
Color usage examples
Component variations and states
Spacing and layout guidelines




Component Library Development:


Could serve as a playground for developing and testing new components
Document component usage and props
Show different component variations and interactions

Would you like me to help you expand the site in any of these directions? For example, I could help:

Create a proper styleguide page
Add more test components
Set up documentation for your design system
Create example pages showing different component combinations
